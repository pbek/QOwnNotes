[QOwnNotes](https://www.qownnotes.org) is the **open source notepad** with
[**markdown support**](https://github.com/pbek/QOwnNotes/blob/develop/src/demonotes/Markdown%20Cheatsheet.md)
and **todo list manager** for **GNU/Linux**, **Mac OS X** and **Windows**,
that works together with [**Nextcloud Notes**](https://github.com/Nextcloud/notes)
and [**ownCloud Notes**](https://github.com/owncloud/notes).

You are able to **write down** your **thoughts** with **QOwnNotes** and **edit or search** for them later from your **mobile device**, like with [CloudNotes](http://peterandlinda.com/cloudnotes/) or the **ownCloud / Nextcloud web-service**.

The notes are stored as **plain text markdown files** and are **synced with Nextcloud's/ownCloud's file sync** functionality.
Of course other software, like [Syncthing](https://syncthing.net) or [Dropbox](https://www.dropbox.com) can be used too.

If you like the concept of having notes accessible in plain text files, like it is done in the Nextcloud / ownCloud notes apps to gain a maximum of **freedom** then QOwnNotes is for you.

Visit the project page here: [QOwnNotes project page](https://www.qownnotes.org)

To manage your **todo lists** in the web and on your mobile devices, you need to
install the Tasks backend on [Nextcloud](https://apps.nextcloud.com/apps/tasks)
or [ownCloud](https://marketplace.owncloud.com/apps/tasks).

To get more on-line features for your notes, like **versioning** and **trash** access, you might also want to install the [QOwnNotesAPI](https://github.com/pbek/qownnotesapi) app on your server.

To access your ownCloud notes from your **mobile device** you may want to get these:
- For Android and OwnCloud: [MyOwnNotes](https://f-droid.org/app/org.aykit.MyOwnNotes)
- For Android and Nextcloud: [Notes](https://f-droid.org/packages/it.niedermann.owncloud.notes)
- For iOS: [CloudNotes](https://itunes.apple.com/app/cloudnotes-owncloud-notes/id813973264)

On Android you could also use any sync-tool like *Synchronize Ultimate* or *FolderSync* to sync your note files and use software like *neutriNotes* or [**Markor**](https://f-droid.org/packages/net.gsantner.markor/) to edit your notes.

On iOS [Notebooks](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/notebooks-write-and-organize/id780438662) may also work well (syncing notes via WebDAV).
