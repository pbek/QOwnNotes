[QOwnNotes](https://www.qownnotes.org) is the **open source notepad** with
[**markdown support**](https://github.com/pbek/QOwnNotes/blob/develop/src/demonotes/Markdown%20Cheatsheet.md)
and **todo list manager** for **GNU/Linux**, **macOS** and **Windows**,
that works together with [**Nextcloud Notes**](https://github.com/Nextcloud/notes)
and [**ownCloud Notes**](https://github.com/owncloud/notes).

You are able to **write down** your **thoughts** with **QOwnNotes** and
**edit or search** for them later from your **mobile device**, like with
[Nextcloud Notes for Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=it.niedermann.owncloud.notes)
or the **Nextcloud / ownCloud web-service**.

The notes are stored as **plain text markdown files** and are
**synced with Nextcloud's/ownCloud's file sync** functionality.
Of course other software, like [Syncthing](https://syncthing.net) or
[Dropbox](https://www.dropbox.com) can be used too.

If you like the concept of having notes accessible in plain text files, like it
is done in the Nextcloud / ownCloud notes apps to gain a maximum of **freedom**
then QOwnNotes is for you.

Visit the project page here: [QOwnNotes project page](https://www.qownnotes.org)

To manage your **todo lists** in the web and on your mobile devices, you need to
install the Tasks backend on [Nextcloud](https://apps.nextcloud.com/apps/tasks)
or [ownCloud](https://marketplace.owncloud.com/apps/tasks).

To get more on-line features for your notes, like **versioning** and **trash** access,
you might also want to install the [QOwnNotesAPI](https://github.com/pbek/qownnotesapi)
app on your server.

To access your ownCloud notes from your **mobile device** you may want to get one of these:

- For Android and OwnCloud: [MyOwnNotes](https://f-droid.org/app/org.aykit.MyOwnNotes)
- For Android and Nextcloud: [Notes](https://f-droid.org/packages/it.niedermann.owncloud.notes)
- For iOS: [CloudNotes](https://itunes.apple.com/app/cloudnotes-owncloud-notes/id813973264)

On Android you could also use any sync-tool like *Synchronize Ultimate* or *FolderSync*
to sync your note files and use software like *neutriNotes* or
[**Markor**](https://f-droid.org/packages/net.gsantner.markor/) to edit your notes.

On iOS [Notebooks](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/notebooks-write-and-organize/id780438662)
may also work well (syncing notes via WebDAV).

## Building QOwnNotes

To get the most current features you can build the application from the source
code. Download the latest source here:
[QOwnNotes Source on GitHub as ZIP](https://github.com/pbek/QOwnNotes/archive/develop.zip)

Alternatively you can also checkout the code directly from the git repository:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/pbek/QOwnNotes.git -b master
cd QOwnNotes
git submodule update --init
```

Then download [Qt Creator](http://www.qt.io/download-open-source), open the
project file `src/QOwnNotes.pro` and click on *Build / Run*.

Or you can build it directly in your terminal:

```shell
cd src

# build binary translation files if you want another language than English
lrelease QOwnNotes.pro

qmake
make
```

### Building QOwnNotes For Development

If you are going to work with the code, then you can do the following instead of the above:

```shell
cd src
qmake CONFIG+=DEV_MODE CONFIG+=debug ..
make -j4
```

The `DEV_MODE` variable enabled higher warning levels + precompiled headers.
