==========================

![qownnotesapi](../assets/img/qownnotesapi.png)

[**QOwnNotesAPI**](https://github.com/pbek/qownnotesapi) can handle the **access** to **trashed notes**
and **note versions** for you.

!!!info
    You can enable QOwnNotesAPI directly in your **Nextcloud** or **ownCloud** instance by searching for `qownnotes`
    in your server's **Apps page** at `https://<your-cloud-domain>/settings/apps`.

    - [Nextcloud Apps page](https://apps.nextcloud.com/apps/qownnotesapi)
    - [ownCloud Apps page](https://marketplace.owncloud.com/apps/qownnotesapi)

Note sharing is done via the API provided by Nextcloud / ownCloud. Tasks are accessed directly via CalDAV.

!!!tip
    Use your **Nextcloud** / **ownCloud** **sync client** to **sync your notes**, your notes are simple markdown files.
    There is no need to invent the wheel twice. And there are also people who are using different services to sync
    their note files (like Dropbox, Syncthing or Resilio Sync).
