# QOwnNotes now has scripting support

<v-subheader class="blog">Date: 2016-05-13</v-subheader>

**QOwnNotes** now has **scripting support** with **QML** and **JavaScript**!

By using the power of the QQmlEngine and QML files with JavaScript you are now able to **script some new behavior** into the application **yourself**.

You will find a new **Scripting tab** in the settings dialog, where you can **add as many scripts** to QOwnNotes **as you like** (you can also disable them temporarily).

Currently you may need to restart QOwnNotes to let changes in a script take action.

I prepared some **[examples and documentation](https://github.com/pbek/QOwnNotes/tree/main/doc/scripting)** to play around with.

If you need access to a certain functionality in QOwnNotes or have **questions or ideas** please open an issue on the [QOwnNotes issue page](https://github.com/pbek/QOwnNotes/issues).
