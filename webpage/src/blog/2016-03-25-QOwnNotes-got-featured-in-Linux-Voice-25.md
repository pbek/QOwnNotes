# QOwnNotes got featured in Linux Voice 25

<v-subheader class="blog">Date: 2016-03-25</v-subheader>

**QOwnNotes** got featured in issue 25 of the very popular **GNU/Linux** and **Free Software** magazine [**Linux Voice**](https://www.linuxvoice.com).

You can get **[issue 25 of Linux Voice](http://shop.linuxvoice.com/products/single-issues)** on their webpage.

Thanks a lot to _Graham_ from _Linux Voice_ to provide me with the article!

Now I know why lately more people are assuming that QOwnNotes is using the notes from **OwnNote**, which it doesn't. :)

**QOwnNotes** uses the same **text files** as the **ownCloud notes** app.  
OwnNote uses HTML in the database.

Please read [Does QOwnNotes support ownNote](https://www.qownnotes.org/Knowledge-base/Does-QOwnNotes-support-ownNote) for more information.
