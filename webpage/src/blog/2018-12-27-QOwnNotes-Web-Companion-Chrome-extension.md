# QOwnNotes Web Companion Chrome extension

<v-subheader class="blog">Date: 2018-12-27</v-subheader>

In version 18.12.7 I added support for the new rudimentary [QOwnNotes Web Companion ](https://github.com/qownnotes/chrome-web-companion/)[Chrome](https://github.com/qownnotes/chrome-web-companion/) [extension](https://github.com/qownnotes/chrome-web-companion/) to add selected text as new note!

You can download the current release of the extension at [QOwnNotes Chrome Web Companion 18.12.0](https://github.com/qownnotes/chrome-web-companion/releases/tag/18.12.0), just drop the file into Chrome to install the extension.

Please head over to [\#330](https://github.com/pbek/QOwnNotes/issues/330) to comment on the development process.
