# New release version RSS feed

<v-subheader class="blog">Date: 2016-01-09</v-subheader>

If you don't want to miss a single version of QOwnNotes you can subscribe to our **[QOwnNotes release version RSS feed](https://www.qownnotes.org/rss/project_version/qownnotes.rss)**.

And if you don't want to miss every source code commit there is the [QOwnNotes GitHub commit RSS feed](https://github.com/pbek/QOwnNotes/commits/develop.atom).

Of course there also is the **[QOwnNotes blog RSS feed](https://www.qownnotes.org/rss.xml)**, if you want the **latest news** about the project.
