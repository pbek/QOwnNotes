# Build and release systems for QOwnNotes for Linux, macOS and Windows!

<v-subheader class="blog">Date: 2015-07-27</v-subheader>

Finally all build and release systems for **[QOwnNotes](http://www.qownnotes.org)** for Linux, macOS and Windows are running well and you always can download the latest release!

I'm using **Travis CI** for **Ubuntu Linux**, visit **[QOwnNotes on Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org/pbek/QOwnNotes)**.

**GitLab CI** is used for creating the **macOS** builds, visit **[QOwnNotes on GitLab CI](https://ci.gitlab.com/projects/5070?ref=develop)**.

And **AppVeyor** is used for creating the builds for **Microsoft Windows**, visit **[QOwnNotes on AppVeyor](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/pbek/qownnotes)**.

You will find all the **new binaries** in the **[download area of the project page](http://www.qownnotes.org/#downloads)**.
