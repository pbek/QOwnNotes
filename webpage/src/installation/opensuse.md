## On every openSUSE version

You can install QOwnNotes using the [OBS Package Installer](https://github.com/openSUSE/opi) tool.

Run the following shell commands as root to install `opi`:

```bash
zypper install opi
```

Then install QOwnNotes with it:

```bash
opi qownnotes
```

::: warning
This tool will query the entire OBS service so be sure to choose `qownnotes`,
and not `qownnotes-lang` if asked.

Also check that the chosen repo is the official `home:pbek:QOwnNotes` and not a third-party one.
:::

::: tip
You need to choose the option to keep the repository after installation to get updates.
