# Install on Arch Linux

## pacman

Add the following lines to your `/etc/pacman.conf` with `sudo nano /etc/pacman.conf`:

```ini
[home_pbek_QOwnNotes_Arch_Extra]
SigLevel = Optional TrustAll
Server = http://download.opensuse.org/repositories/home:/pbek:/QOwnNotes/Arch_Extra/$arch
```

Run the following shell commands to trust the repository:

```bash
wget http://download.opensuse.org/repositories/home:/pbek:/QOwnNotes/Arch_Extra/x86_64/home_pbek_QOwnNotes_Arch_Extra.key -O - | sudo pacman-key --add -
sudo pacman-key --lsign-key F2205FB121DF142B31450865A3BA514562A835DB
```

If the command `sudo pacman-key --lsign-key F2205FB121DF142B31450865A3BA514562A835DB` fails with a message like: `ERROR: FFC43FC94539B8B0 could not be locally signed.`, you could first find out the actual *keyid* of the downloaded key, i.e. with the command (and output):

```bash
gpg /path/to/downloaded/home_pbek_QOwnNotes_Arch_Extra.key
gpg: WARNING: no command supplied.  Trying to guess what you mean ...
pub   rsa2048 2019-07-31 [SC] [expires: 2021-10-10]
      F2205FB121DF142B31450865A3BA514562A835DB
uid           home:pbek OBS Project <home:pbek@build.opensuse.org>
```

You can now synchronize your package database and install the package with `pacman`:

```bash
sudo pacman -Syy qownnotes
```
