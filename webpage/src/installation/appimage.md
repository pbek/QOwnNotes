# Install as AppImage

You can download the latest AppImage from the [QOwnNotes releases page](https://github.com/pbek/QOwnNotes/releases).
It should be named like `QOwnNotes-x86_64.AppImage` on that page.

Then you can change the execute-permissions on the file:

```bash
chmod a+x QOwnNotes-*.AppImage
```

Afterwards you should be able to execute the AppImage to run QOwnNotes.

::: warning
If you want to use the **automatic updater** please make sure to put your
AppImage in a place where your user account has write access to, like somewhere
in your home directory.
