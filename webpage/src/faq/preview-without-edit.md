# How can I just show the preview panel without the note edit panel?

You can do that by turning off that the **note edit panel** is the **central widget** in the **Panel settings**.

Then best create a new workspace `Preview only` by clicking **Window / Workspace / Add new workspace** in the main menu. You will be able to switch between different panel layouts.

Afterwards you can turn off the note edit panel in the **Window / Panels menu**.

Keep in mind that you can move around all panels as you like by clicking **Window / Unlock panels** in the main menu. You can also resize all panels to fit your needs.

Alternatively you can switch to the **Preview only** layout in the **Layout settings**.
