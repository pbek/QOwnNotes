# new suggestion methods of Hunspell 1.5:
# capitalization: nasa -> NASA
# long swap: permenant -> permanent
# long mov: Ghandi -> Gandhi
# double two characters: vacacation -> vacation
# space with REP: "alot" -> "a lot" ("a lot" need to be in the dic file.)
#
# Note: see test "ph" for the newer and
# more simple method to handle common misspellings,
# for example, alot->a lot, inspite->in spite,
# (that is giving the best suggestion, and limiting
# ngram/phonetic suggestion)

# switch off ngram suggestion for testing
