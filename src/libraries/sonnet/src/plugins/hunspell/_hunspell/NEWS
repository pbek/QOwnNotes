2018-11-12: Hunspell 1.7.0 release:

  New features and bug fixes by L·szlÛ NÈmeth, supported by FSF.hu Foundation:

  - No annoying suggestion times any more, especially in languages with
    compound word handling and complex morphology. By adding balanced
    multi-level time limits, now the guaranteed suggestion time is there
    within half a second, not seconds (nor dozen of seconds or more
    in extreme cases) for longer misspellings, too.

  - add SPELLML support for run-time dictionary extension with optional
    affixation of user words. See new "Grammar By" feature of
    language-specific user dictionaries of LibreOffice 6.0:

    Screencast with English example: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EsS3gaBTfOo

    Screencast with German example: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aYVFDqCUb6I

  - Improved, highly customizable suggestions on level of dictionary words:
    Pronunciations and typical misspellings defined by optional "ph:" fields of
    the dictionary words are used not only in n-gram suggestions, but as
    elements of the REP replacement list getting the highest priority in normal
    suggestions, also giving the best suggestions for short words, too.
    More information: see "ph:" in man 5 hunspell.

  - Handling multiple word suggestions is much more easier. Like in a
    traditional spelling dictionary, for example, to get the correct suggestion
    "a lot" for the typical misspelling "alot" at the first place, now it's
    enough to put the following line to the dic(tionary) file:

    a lot

  - Limit compound overgeneration by dictionary based word pairs:
    Now it's possible to filter bad compound words by listing
    the correct word pairs with space in the dictionary, as in a traditional
    spelling dictionary.

  - clean-up suggestion:

    - no n-gram and compound word suggestions, if "good" suggestion
      exists, ie. uppercase, REP, ph: or dictionary word pair suggestions

    - word pairs are always suggested, if they exist in the dic file

    - word pairs have top priority in suggestions, and
      these are the only suggestions if there is no other good suggestion.

    - also dictionary word pairs separated by dash instead of space
      are handled specially in two-word suggestion (depending from the
      language)

   - limit bad suggestions by improved n-gram suggestion rules:

     don't suggest capitalized dictionary words for lower
     case misspellings in n-gram suggestions, except

     - PHONE usage, or
     - in the case of German, where not only proper
       nouns are capitalized, or
     - the capitalized word has special pronunciation

     and don't suggest if the difference of lengths of misspellings and
     suggestions is 5 or more characters.

  - Extend dotless i and dotted I rules to Crimean Tatar language
    Allow dotted I in dictionary, and disable bad capitalization of i.

  - BREAK: extended recursive word breaking algorithm to handle words or
    words with suffixes when they already contain word break characters,
    for example, "e-mail" is a dictionary word with a word break character, and
    it wasn't accepted before in compounds in some languages.

  - FORBIDDENWORD precedes BREAK: Now it's possible to forbid compound
    forms recognized by BREAK word breaking by adding the bad compounds to
    the dictionary with FORBIDDENWORD flags.

  - lower limit for "doubletwochars" suggestion algorithm:
    one of the typical misspellings recognized by Hunspell suggestion
    mechanism is the syllable duplication. Along the old pattern
    ABABA -> ABA, for example nutrITITIon -> nutrITIon, now also the
    simpler ABAB -> AB pattern is recognized in non-starting position,
    for example, regretTETEd -> regretTEd.

  - lower limit for longswapchar and movechar: recognized only max.
    4-character distances to avoid slow and bad suggestions.

  - fix compound handling for new Hungarian orthography reform

  - Allow suggestion search for prefix + *two suffixes*:
    Remove artificial performance limit to get correct
    suggestions for relatively simple misspellings in
    Hungarian, etc., when the word form contains prefix
    and both derivative and inflectional suffixes, too:

    lefiksz·l·sa -> lefix·l·sa

  Improvements for command-line Hunspell:

  - Remove false alarms during checking OpenDocument (ODF)
    documents by ignoring <text:span> elements. (LibreOffice
    creates a lot of <text:span> elements also within words
    during text reediting, resulted often huge amount of broken
    words before this fix.)

  - List filenames during filtering multiple files in command-line:

    Examples:

    $ hunspell -l *.odt
    a.odt: mispelling
    b.odt: egzample

    $ hunspell -l -G *.odt
    a.odt: good
    b.odt: words

  - Dictionary search by option -D doesn't wait for the standard input
    (fixed by Siva Mahadevan)

  Other improvements:

  - makealias dictionary compression: add option --minimize-diff
    to reuse free positions of alias lists to create minimal and
    readable diffs for alias compressed dictionaries stored in
    revision control systems, as dictionaries of LibreOffice.

    instead of by work breaking code of OpenOffice.org. With this feature
    it's possible to accept hyphenated compound words, such as "scot-free",
    where "scot" is not a correct English word.

  - ICONV & OCONV: input and output conversion tables for optional character
    handling or using special inner format. Example:

  # Accepting de facto replacements of the Romanian comma acuted letters
  SET UTF-8
  ICONV 4
  ICONV ≈ü »ô
  ICONV ≈£ »õ

    version of unmunch).

  - bug fixes

2008-08-15: Hunspell 1.2.7 release:
  - FULLSTRIP: new option for affix handling. With FULLSTRIP, affix rules can
    strip full words, not only one less characters.
  - COMPOUNDRULE works with all flag types. (COMPOUNDRULE is for pattern
    matching. For example, en_US dictionary of OpenOffice.org uses COMPOUNDRULE
    for ordinal number recognition: 1st, 2nd, 11th, 12th, 22nd, 112th, 1000122nd
    etc.).
  - optimized suggestions:
    - modified 1-character distance suggestion algorithms: search a TRY character
      in all position instead of all TRY characters in a character position
      (it can give more readable suggestion order, also better suggestions
      in the first positions, when TRY characters are sorted by frequency.)
      For example, suggestions for "moze":
      ooze, doze, Roze, maze, more etc. (Hunspell 1.2.6),
      maze, more, mote, ooze, mole etc. (Hunspell 1.2.7).
    - extended compound word checking for better COMPOUNDRULE related
      suggestions, for example English ordinal numbers: 121323th -> 121323rd
      (it needs also a th->rd REP definition).
  - bug fixes

2005-08-26: Hunspell 1.0.9 release

* improved related character map suggestion

* improved ngram suggestion

------ examples for ngram improvement (O=old, N = new ngram suggestions) --

O: supermen, newspapermen, empowerment, endangerment, preferments,
        preferment, permanent, preferment's, permanently, impermanent

N: permanent, supermen, preferment

Note: new suggestions are also weighted with longest common subsequence,
first letter and common character positions

3. pernemant (instead of permanent) 

O: pimpernel's, pimpernel, pimpernels, permanently, permanents, permanent,
        supernatant, impermanent, semipermanent, impermanently

N: permanent, supernatant, pimpernel

Note: new method also prefers root word instead of not
relevant affixes ('s, s and ly)


4. pernament (instead of permanent)

O: tournaments, tournament, ornaments, ornament's, ornamenting, ornamented,
        ornament, ornamentals, ornamental, ornamentally

N: ornamental, ornament, tournament

Note: Both ngram methods misses here.


5. obvus (instad of obvious):

O: obvious, Corvus, obverse, obviously, Jacobus, obtuser, obtuse,
        obviates, obviate, Travus

N: obvious, obtuse, obverse

Note: new method also prefers common first letters.


6. unambigus (instead of unambiguous) 

O: unambiguous, unambiguity, unambiguously, ambiguously, ambiguous,
        unambitious, ambiguities, ambiguousness

N: unambiguous, unambiguity, unambitious



7. consecvence (instead of consequence)

O: consecutive, consecutively, consecutiveness, nonconsecutive, consequence,
        consecutiveness's, convenience's, consistences, consistence

N: consequence, consecutive, consecrates


An example in a language with rich morphology:

8. Misisipiben (instead of Mississippiben [`in Mississippi' in Hungarian]):

O: MisikÈdÈiben, PisisedÈiben, MisikÈiÈiben, PisisekÈiben, MisikÈiben,
        MisikÈidÈiben, MisikÈkÈiben, MisikÈikÈiben, MisikÈimÈiben, Mississippiiben

N: Mississippiben, Mississippiiben, Misiiben

Note: Suggesting not relevant affixes was the biggest fault in ngram
   suggestion for languages with a lot of affixes.

--------------- end of examples --------------------

* support twofold prefix cutting

* lots of other improvements and bug fixes (see ChangeLog)

* test Hunspell with 54 OpenOffice.org dictionaries:

In en_AU dictionary, there is an abbrevation with two dots (`eqn..'), but
`eqn.' is missing. Presumably it is a dictionary bug. Myspell also
haven't accepted it.

Hungarian dictionary contains pseudoroots and forbidden words.
Unmunch haven't supported these features yet, and generates bad words, too.

* check affix rules and OOo dictionaries. Detected bugs in cs_CZ,
es_ES, es_NEW, es_MX, lt_LT, nn_NO, pt_PT, ro_RO, sk_SK and sv_SE dictionaries).
