hunzip \- compress and encrypt dictionary files
.SH SYNOPSIS
hzip [\-h] [\-P password] [file(s)]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I hunzip
is a small utility for text file compression and encryption, especially for
sorted dictionaries. "hunspell filename" creates the compressed
file "filename.hz" without removing the original file.

The compression algorithm uses 16-bit Huffman encoding and
line-oriented prefix-suffix compression. It has good
compression ratio for huge sorted word lists.
