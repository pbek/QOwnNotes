 * based off a perl script originally written by Maciej Ceglowski <maciej@ceglowski.com>
 * called Languid. His script used a 2 part huristic to determine language. First the text
 * is is checked for the scripts it contains, then for each set of languages useing those
 * scripts a n-gram frequency model of a given language is compared to a model of the text.
 * The most similar language model is assumed to be the language. If no language is found
 * an empty string is returned.
