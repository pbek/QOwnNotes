# QOwnNotes Changelog

## 18.06.2
- added `cups-control` to he snap version of QOwnNotes to possibly enable 
  support for printing to printers (for [#938](https://github.com/pbek/QOwnNotes/issues/938))
- added tagging support for subfolders (for [#884](https://github.com/pbek/QOwnNotes/issues/884),
  a big thank you to @cal2195)
- added new **Chinese Traditional translation** (for [#934](https://github.com/pbek/QOwnNotes/issues/934),
  a big thank you to @abev66)
    - the current translation `Chinese` was renamed to `Chinese Simplified`
- the desktop file `QOwnNotes.desktop` was renamed to `PBE.QOwnNotes.desktop`
  for the Wayland compositor (for [#933](https://github.com/pbek/QOwnNotes/issues/933))

## 18.06.1
- when the application gets restarted from the *Settings dialog* a possible
  `--clear-settings` parameter will now not be appended as parameter, so the 
  settings will not get removed a second time after the restart
- added a new scripting hook `handleNoteNameHook(note)` that is called when the
  note name is determined for a note
  (for [#929](https://github.com/pbek/QOwnNotes/issues/929))
    - take a look at the
      [handleNoteNameHook documentation](https://docs.qownnotes.org/en/develop/scripting/README.html#handlenotenamehook)
      for more information
    - the user interface will currently not be updated when the note text (that 
      could result in a note name change with the new hook) is stored

## 18.06.0
- encrypted notes are now read-only in the editor unless you are using
  *Edit encrypted note* or you are decrypting it (for [#815](https://github.com/pbek/QOwnNotes/issues/815))
- fixed storing of keyboard shortcuts in the *Shortcuts settings*
  (for [#912](https://github.com/pbek/QOwnNotes/issues/912))

## 18.05.7
- despite users having problems in the past with fetching the update request 
  via SSL are we trying to use https for the update request again
  (for [#918](https://github.com/pbek/QOwnNotes/issues/918))
    - the QOwnNotes webpage <http://www.qownnotes.org> will now also be 
      automatically redirected to <https://www.qownnotes.org>
- it now will not be attempted to store a new note text if the note file is read-only
  (for [#916](https://github.com/pbek/QOwnNotes/issues/916))
    - this was especially a problem for the `noteTaggingHook` scripting 
      method, because the note text is modified there most of the time
        - but the user interface still might think that a tag was added to or
          removed from a note, because the `noteTaggingHook` scripting method 
          might not necessarily modify the note text, but use for example an 
          external database
- when pasting HTML code with <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>â‡§</kbd> + <kbd>V</kbd>
  the escaped characters `&gt;`,`&lt;` and `&amp;` will now be unescaped to
